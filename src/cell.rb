# Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
# Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
# Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
# Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
#
# The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system.
# The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seedâ€”births
# and deaths occur simultaneously,
# and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick
# (in other words, each generation is a pure function of the preceding one).
# The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.
